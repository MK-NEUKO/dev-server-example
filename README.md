# Dev Server Example

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Clean Architecture** in a **multi-container cloud application**. It was developed with the goal of utilizing best practices and modern technologies to create a robust and scalable solution. 

The app provides a **development server** with **client integration**, which can be used by various sectors of the **IT industry**. Whether **UI/UX designers** or **web agencies**, the client integration during the development phase enables **quick and valuable feedback**.

An **optional feature** would be the implementation of a **custom client management system**. This would allow the entire order processing – **from quotation to invoice** – to be designed in a **customer-friendly, clear, and transparent** manner. 

## The following system diagram illustrates the architecture and main components of the app:
